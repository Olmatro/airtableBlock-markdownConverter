# Markdown to Html Converter

Type Markdown in (Airtable)[http://airtable.com/], preview as HTML, and save the HTML in another field for publishing.

## What this Block Does

This custom block for Airtable allows a user to edit text in markdown, preview it as html, and 
automatically save the resulting html in a different field. 

The block can apply custom css to the preview, so you can get a better feel for how the final post will look like.

## How to remix this block

1. Create a new base (or you can use an existing base).

2. Create a new block in your base (see [Create a new block](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-block),
   selecting "Remix from Github" as your template.

3. From the root of your new block, run `block run`.
